# Image_Caption_Generator

Here I have used nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning model from huggingface. It's a combination of Vision Transformer and GPT-2 architecture.

Vision Transformer- Images are divided into fixed patches and each patch is treated as a token.
GPT-2 model is used for text generation.

It is deployed using Gradio interface.
